          <h2>Correlations Observed Between Health Risks, Age, and Income</h2>
          <p>We can see observable trends between health risk markers, such as Obesity, Smoking, and Lack of Healthcare, with
            the level of Median Income and the Percentage of the Population that lives under the Poverty line. Age may have some
            bearing on health risk factors, but the plot of Median Age against the observed risk factors does not show a salient 
            trend.</p>

          <p>An increase in median income seems to have an ameliorative effect on health risk factors. There is an inverse correlation,
            or downward trend, between lack of healthcare, smoking rates, and obesity with increase median income. This would suggest 
            that as income increases, health improves. This assumption is further strengthened by the observation between poverty and
            health risk factors. As the percentage of those living in poverty increases so do the observed health risk factors. Higher
            incidences of poverty show a higher perentage of people living without adequate access to healthcare, higher smoking rates,
            and higher obesity rates.</p>

          <p>Median age is a little more difficult when trying to deduce a trend. Median age across most states is clustered around
            the same range, mid to upper 30s. This clustering obfuscates deteriming possible trends. The dense cluster of ages centers
            around an average of 12% when looking at the lack of healthcare factor. There seems to be a slight trend between median age
            and percentage of smokers; the lower the median age the lower incidences of smoking. Large scale local, state, and federal 
            policies aimed at reducing the smoking, reducing exposure to smoke, tightening access to tobacco products, regulating tobacco
            sales and advertisement, and increasing education of the toll smoking takes on a person's health may have greatly contributed
            to the decline in smoking. There may be a possible, albeit weak, correlation between median age and obesity rates; however, 
            based on the chart, median age is an ill predictor of obesity rates.</p>
